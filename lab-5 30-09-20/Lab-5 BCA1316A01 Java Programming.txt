Topics: Classes & Objects, Methods and Constructors

1. What's wrong with the following program?

public class SomethingIsWrong {
public static void main(String[] args) {
Rectangle myRect; //something missing here
myRect.width = 40;
myRect.height = 50;
System.out.printin("myRect's area is " + myRect.area());

2. Fix the program called SomethingIsWrong shown in Question 1 by adding appropriate fields
and methods to make is function.

3. Complete the program called SomethingIsWrong shown in Question 1 by adding appropriate
fields and methods to make is function.

4. Given the following class, called NumberHolder, write some code that creates an
instance of the class, initializes its two member variables, and then displays the value
of each member variable.

public class NumberHolder {
public int anInt;
public float aFloat;

Q5.
i. Creates a Student class, take rolINo and name as a field of this class, and print the
values of these fields in main class without assigning values to the fileds.

ii. Assign the value of id as 'your rollNo' and that of name as "your name" by creating an
object of the class Student.

iii. Assign the value of id as ‘your rollNo' and that of name as "your name" by creating a
method (not the constructor) of the class Student.

iv. Assign and print the roll number, and name of two students respectively by creating
two objects of class ‘Student’.

v. Assign and print the roll number, and name of five students respectively by creating
five objects of class 'Student’.

vi. Add getter and setter methods in the previous program for rolINo and name.

vii. Add an empty default constructor in the previous program.

viii. Add a parameterised constructor in the previous program and initialize the values of
rollNo and name.

Q6.
i. Write a program to print the area and perimeter of a triangle having sides of 3, 4 and 5
units by creating a class named 'Triangle' without any parameter in its constructor.

ii. Create a class Rectangle and calculate the area of the rectangle of 3 rectangles.

iii. In the previous program, check that an object is the instance of the class Rectangle or
not.

iv. In the previous program, create the object with var.

v. In the previous program, create an anonymous object.
