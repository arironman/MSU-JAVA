Topics: Array and Strings
Arrays

1. Create an array of integer type in different ways.

2. Create an array of integer type and store the values of float types. Report the error that you

get.

3. Create an array of character types. Can we convert this array into a String? If yes, please do.

4. Write a program to create arrays of all the primitive types.

5. Write a program to iterate over the array and print its elements. (Use for loop)

6. Write a program to iterate over the array and print its elements. (Use while loop)

7. Write a program to iterate over the array and print its elements. (Use for each loop)

8. Write a program to print the elements of an integer/float array after doubling.

9. Write a program that sums the elements of a char array.

10. Find the length of an array.

11. Write a method which takes an array as a parameter and returns the sum of all of its elements.

12. Write a program to access an element of the array beyond its length. Report the
error/exception if any.

13. Write a program to copy all elements of one array into another array.

14. Write a program to find the frequency of each element in the array.

15. Write a program to print the duplicate elements of an array.

16. Write a program to print the elements of an array in reverse order.

17. Write a program to print the elements of an array present on even position.

18. Write a program to print the elements of an array present on odd position.
